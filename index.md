Artil
=============

Artil stands for "Art Information Logistics". It is an art pieces inventory for art management structures (galleries, museums, and collectors).

## Business model

The model is centered around the main **Art Piece** object that decribes the piece (size, year, technique...). 

Art pieces:
- have an owner
- can be tagged
- belong to a place

Invoices containing one to many art pieces can be generated.
