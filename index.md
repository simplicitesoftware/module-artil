# Artil

**Artil** is an **art pieces inventory** for art management structures (galleries, museums, and collectors). Artil stands for "Art Information Logistics".

This app was built with the [Simplicité platform](https://www.simplicite.io).

## Business model

The model is centered around the main **Art Piece** object that decribes the piece (size, year, technique...). 

Art pieces:
- have an owner
- can be tagged
- belong to a place

Invoices containing one to many art pieces can be generated.
